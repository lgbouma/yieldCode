Given a list of camera pointings (in ecliptic coords), and a catalog of 
stars to be observed (postage stamps, and eventually FFIs - the catalog is
of their camera number, pointing number, and ecliptic coordinates of the
camera boresight), find the number of pointings each star in this catalog 
gets.
